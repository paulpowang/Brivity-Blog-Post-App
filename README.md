### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### What I did in this project:

provide the UI for users to perform the following actions:
Create an Account and authenticate against protected API endpoints using JWT, user can remain signin until logout
Create, edit and delete posts
Comment on posts
Browse and read blog posts and comments from other users

Styled with Tailwind CSS
Use useContext hook
Add pagination button for posts and comments when there are 30 items or more, since it's 30 item per page
Use React Router
